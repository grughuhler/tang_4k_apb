This directory contains an example application for the Cortex M3 core on
the Tang Nano 4K FPGA development board.

It demonstrates UART0 and two APB2 completers.

I build the software on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04).  Actually, I run Ubuntu under
the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2).

You will need to install a toolchain for the Cortex M3.  On Ubuntu, you
can do

  sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi

Also be sure that "make" is installed and the build by running

  make

This should create file prog.bin.

You flash this on the FPGA on Windows by running the Gowin Programmer and

  1.  Double click on the Operation
  2.  Select Access Mode: MCU Mode
  3.  Select Operation: "Firmware Erase; Program
  4.  Select Firmware/Binary File: prog.bin
  5.  Save
  6.  Then click on the Program/Configure icon to do the flashing.

On Linux with openFPGALoader, try

  openFPGALoader -b tangnano4k -f tang_4k_getting_started.fs --mcufw prog.bin
There is a hassle with UARTs on the Tang Nano 4K: the board does
not connect any UART signals to the USB chip.  This means you must use
external pins and a USB to 3.3V serial adapter. See file
../src/tang_4k_getting_started.cst for the pin numbers.  Pin uart0_txd is
the one the M3 transmits on.

When the M3 runs, you should see

1.  The onboard LED blinks (controlled by PWM controller)
2.  Some stuff gets printed.
3.  Type "he" to list commands.  You can use "ww" and "rr" to access the
    completer registers.
