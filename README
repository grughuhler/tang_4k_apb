This project is an example showing how to create APB bus completers
for the Cortex M3 core on the Tang Nano 4K FPGA development board.
This is the simplest way to connect designs created from FPGA
resources to the Cortex M3 subsystem on the FPGA.

The FPGA implements version 2 of the specification (APB2).  See ARM's
document AMBAÂ® APB Protocol Specification, ARM IHI 0024E (ID022823).

The two completers are:

1.  Some registers.  Base address 0x40002400.

This is just four 32-bit memory-mapped registers that software on the
M3 can read and write using word (32-bit), half-word, or byte loads
and stores.

2.  A PWM controller with one output that is connected to the LED on
    the Tang Nano 4K. Base address 0x40002500.

      Registers
40002400:  Register 0
40002404:  Register 1
40002408:  Register 2
4000240c:  Register 3

40002500:  counter_limit
40002504:  on_limit

Cortex-M3 UART0 is also enabled.  Use speed 115200, 8-bits.  No parity
or flow control.  See src/tang_4k_apb.cst for pin assignments.  There
serial rx and tx pins are 3.3V.  You will need something like a USB to
CMOS serial adapter.  Type "he" to see a list of commands the software
provides.

See c_code/README for software.

Build the FPGA image using the Gowin IDE.  A project is provided.
